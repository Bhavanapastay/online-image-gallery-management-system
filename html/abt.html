Designed and implemented by Bhavana,Arshiya and Arun.India's diversity and complexity can be witnessed through its people, traditions and values associated with distinctive regional customs, lifestyle, food and festival. That's way our images reflect the innate expressions of deep-rooted feelings of individuals through which spring their day to day actions. Indians believe in sharing happiness and sorrow together as a community. While doing so, there are unique mannerisms and expressions which are captured in our extensive library of creative imagery . This web site creators were inspired by Sandeep Maheshwari's work of Images Bazar </p>
